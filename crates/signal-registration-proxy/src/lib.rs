//! Signal Registration Proxy - TEE-secured phone number registration service.
//!
//! This proxy sits in front of the Signal CLI REST API to:
//! - Allow self-service registration of new phone numbers
//! - Prevent re-registration attacks on already-registered numbers
//! - Persist registration state with TEE-encrypted storage
